<h1> Connect Four </h1>
<p>Connect Four is a two-player connection game in which the players take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. I have implemented both a CLI and GUI and the computer does its best to not let you get bored. </p>
